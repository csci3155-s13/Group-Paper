Comments on Connor's section:
- Think we should move the definition of fork-join parallelism and strictness to the beginning.
- Bulleted lists should be consolidated into paragraphs
- One or two instances of informal language (contractions, etc) could be changed

Comments on Dylan's section:
- Some repeated content from Connor's part
- A bit more elaboration would be useful, especially near the end of the section

Comments on Derek's section:
- Since this is the last section, a little conluding paragraph would be a great addition
