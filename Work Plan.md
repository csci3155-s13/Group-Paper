This is the proposal for the distribution of work for this assignment:

**A. Rough Draft**  
We split the paper up into three more or less equal parts that work independently of each other. Type up the sections separately (locally) and then edit them into the file on the GitHub repo when completed so changes don't overwrite each other.  
  
Referring to the Intel design document, Connor will cover material from sections 3 and 4, Derek will cover section 6, and Dylan will cover section 7.  
  
Word count for each person will be approximately 300 for now.  
  
**B. Final Copy**  
TBD
