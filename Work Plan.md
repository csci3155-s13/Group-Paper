This is my proposal for the distribution of work for this assignment:

**A. Rough Draft**  
We split the paper up into three more or less equal parts that work independently of each other. Type up the sections separately (locally) and then edit them into the file on the GitHub repo when completed so changes don't overwrite each other.

**B. Final Copy**  
TBD
